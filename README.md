[![balena deploy button](https://www.balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/ShiromMakkad/LedFx-balenaSound)

You can also clone the repository and use `balena push` to deploy your code with any changes. 

## Hardware Requirements

Minimum Required: Raspberry Pi 3B+

**Strongly** recommended: Raspberry Pi 4

Both balenaSound and LedFx alone have minimum requirements at the 3B+, and balenaSound alone still has issues on the 3B+. It's possible to run them both on a 3B+, but it has significant lag. 

## Configuration

See [balenaSound customization](https://sound.balenalabs.io/docs/customization)
